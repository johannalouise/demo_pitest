# Demo for Pitest with the IntelliJ plugin
This project is created by Johanna Iivanainen (jii@kth.se) and Louise Zetterlund (louiseze@kth.se) for the course DD2482 Automated Software Testing and DevOps. 

The purpose with this repository is that you can use this one if you want to try to generate mutation tests with the software [Pitest](https://pitest.org) and its plugin for the IDEA IntelliJ.

### Tutorial

IDEA IntelliJ 2019.3  
Java 11

JUnit 4.13

You can use both of them for setting up this repository.

2. Open the project in IntelliJ
3. Mark the directory `src/main/java` as Sources Root and the directory `src/test/java` as the Test Sources Root.
